### Components and Responsibilities

- **Invoice Service**

  - **Generate invoices** when a resume is unlocked, ensuring proper tracking and billing for resume access.
  - Provide downloadable and email receipts to users, maintaining a detailed transaction history for audit purposes.
  - Integrate with **external payment systems** to process secure transactions for resume unlocks and other services.
  - Manage payment verification, refunds, and compliance with financial regulations.

### Driving Architectural Characteristics

#### Top 3

- **Configurability**: The Invoice Quantum must support the **feasibility to use external services** (such as payment gateways or invoicing platforms), allowing flexibility in integrating third-party services that streamline processes and reduce development overhead.

- **Data Integrity**: Since the platform **processes payments**, ensuring **data integrity** is crucial for secure and accurate handling of financial transactions. Invoices must be reliable, traceable, and compliant with regulations to protect both users and the business.

- **Workflow**: To maintain **observability** and **maintainability**, the workflow of the Invoice Quantum should be designed with structured processes and monitoring in mind, ensuring that any errors in invoice generation or payment processing can be quickly identified and resolved.

### Trade-offs - Mitigation strategies

# Trade-offs and Mitigation Strategies for Microkernel Architecture

## Trade-offs

1. **Complexity**
   - **Trade-off**: The architecture can become complex due to the interaction between the core kernel and numerous plugins or modules.
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain clear documentation and modular design principles. Use standardized interfaces to simplify interactions and provide training for development teams.

2. **Performance Overhead**
   - **Trade-off**: The use of a microkernel can introduce performance overhead due to context switching between the kernel and user-space modules.
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize communication protocols and consider using efficient inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms. Profile performance regularly to identify and address bottlenecks.

3. **Development Time**
   - **Trade-off**: Developing and integrating multiple plugins can increase overall development time.
   - **Mitigation**: Utilize scaffolding tools and templates to speed up plugin development. Establish a clear plugin architecture and guidelines to streamline the process.

4. **Dependency Management**
   - **Trade-off**: Managing dependencies between the core kernel and various plugins can be challenging, leading to potential conflicts.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement strict versioning and compatibility checks for plugins. Use dependency injection to manage dependencies more effectively.

5. **Security Risks**
   - **Trade-off**: A larger attack surface may exist due to multiple plugins and external modules interacting with the kernel.
   - **Mitigation**: Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments. Employ strict access controls and sandboxing techniques to isolate plugins from critical kernel functions.

6. **Consistency and Reliability**
   - **Trade-off**: Ensuring consistent behavior and reliability across various plugins can be difficult, especially with different development teams.
   - **Mitigation**: Create a robust testing framework and continuous integration pipeline to validate plugins against the core kernel. Enforce coding standards and best practices.

7. **Deployment Complexity**
   - **Trade-off**: Deploying and managing multiple plugins alongside the core kernel can complicate deployment processes.
   - **Mitigation**: Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to encapsulate plugins and the kernel, allowing for easier deployment and management. Implement automation tools for deployment.

8. **Learning Curve**
   - **Trade-off**: Teams may face challenges understanding the microkernel architecture and its associated patterns.
   - **Mitigation**: Provide comprehensive training and resources to familiarize teams with the architecture and its best practices.

By acknowledging these trade-offs and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, organizations can effectively leverage the benefits of a microkernel architecture while minimizing its challenges.
