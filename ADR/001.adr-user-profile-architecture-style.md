Date: 2024-09-27

## Status
Proposed 

## Context
User profile quanta consists of the core services in our architecture

ClearView platform is a greenfield project. It comes with ambiguities and risks.

### Alternatives

* Microservice
* Modular Monolith
* Event Driven

### PrOACT

| Factor      | Microservice | Modular Monolith | Event Driven|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Agility  | High | Low | Low
| Scalability | High | Low | High
| Performance | Low | Medium | High
| Cost | High | Low | Medium

## Decision

* **Microservice + Event Driven** should be the right architecture style for this quanta. Given the ambiguity and agility requirements in this quanta, microservice with event driven system would the right fit. However, if there is a very strong cost constraint and just want to do a fast market fit evaluation, we can start with monolith and later move to microservice + event driven once the market fit is identified
  
# Trade-offs and Mitigation Strategies for Microservices + Event-Driven Architecture

## Trade-offs

1. **Complexity**
   - **Trade-off**: The system becomes more complex due to the distribution of services and the need for event handling.
   - **Mitigation**: Use service mesh tools (like Istio or Linkerd) to manage communication and monitor services. Comprehensive documentation and clear architectural guidelines can help teams navigate this complexity.

2. **Data Consistency**
   - **Trade-off**: Achieving strong consistency across microservices can be challenging due to eventual consistency in event-driven architectures.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement patterns like Saga or CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) to manage distributed transactions and maintain data consistency across services.

3. **Event Handling Overhead**
   - **Trade-off**: Introducing an event bus or broker can add latency and overhead in processing events.
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize event processing by using asynchronous communication, batching events, and leveraging lightweight messaging protocols (like gRPC or Kafka).

4. **Debugging and Monitoring**
   - **Trade-off**: Troubleshooting issues in a distributed, event-driven environment can be more difficult compared to monolithic systems.
   - **Mitigation**: Invest in robust logging, tracing (like OpenTelemetry), and monitoring solutions (like Prometheus or Grafana) to gain visibility into service interactions and event flows.

5. **Deployment Complexity**
   - **Trade-off**: Deploying and managing multiple microservices can introduce operational overhead.
   - **Mitigation**: Use container orchestration platforms (like Kubernetes) to automate deployment, scaling, and management of microservices.

6. **Network Reliability**
   - **Trade-off**: Increased reliance on network communication can lead to issues if services are not resilient.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement patterns like circuit breakers and retries to handle transient failures, ensuring services can gracefully recover from network issues.

7. **Learning Curve**
   - **Trade-off**: Teams may face a steep learning curve in adopting microservices and event-driven architectures.
   - **Mitigation**: Provide training sessions, workshops, and mentoring to familiarize teams with new technologies and architectural principles.

8. **Versioning and Compatibility**
   - **Trade-off**: Managing versions of microservices and events can lead to compatibility issues.
   - **Mitigation**: Establish clear versioning strategies and backward compatibility practices, along with automated tests to validate integrations during updates.

By being aware of these trade-offs and implementing effective mitigation strategies, organizations can better navigate the complexities of a microservices architecture combined with event-driven design, leading to more scalable and resilient systems.
