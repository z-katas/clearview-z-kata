# Integration Service for HR Platform Using Event-Driven Microkernel Architecture

Date: 2024-09-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are developing an AI service to connect with various external LLM cloud providers, focusing on workflow requirements and high evolvability. This service should leverage an event-driven architecture within a microkernel style, allowing for easy integration with various LLM model provider systems without compromising on performance. This approach will facilitate scalability, adaptability, and responsiveness to changing business needs.

### Alternatives
1. **Event-driven-microkernel**:  Microkernel for external LLM cloud providers and event driven for workflow service
2. **Point-to-Point Integration**: Directly connect each application to the LLM provider.
3. **Monolithic Middleware**: Use a monolithic middleware service to handle all LLM providers.

### PrOACT

- **Problem**: How can we design a configurable/evolvable AI service that integrates easily with various LLM providers and supports workflow requirements without compromising on performance?

- **Objectives**:
  - Enable seamless integration with multiple LLM providers.
  - Support high configurability/performance for different model workflows.
  - Ensure minimal disruption when migrating to new LLM providers.

- **Alternatives**: As described above.

- **Consequences**:
  - Event driven microkernel requires additional maintainance
  - Point-to-Point Integration leads to scalability issues and high maintenance overhead.
  - Monolithic Middleware lacks flexibility and complicates future integrations.

- **Trade-offs**:
  - An event-driven microkernel architecture allows for extensibility but may require additional infrastructure for event management.
  - Monolithic solutions are simpler initially but limit scalability and adaptability over time.

## Decision
Adopt an event-driven microkernel architecture for the AI service. This design will use a core microkernel that handles common AI functionalities, while modular plugins will manage specific integrations with various LLM providers. Events will drive the communication between services, and workflow enabling real-time processing and easy scalability.

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Complexity**: The event-driven microkernel can introduce complexity in managing events and plugins.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement robust documentation and training programs, alongside a user-friendly interface for managing integrations and events.

- **Performance**: Potential latency due to the overhead of event processing and additional modules.
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize event handling and employ asynchronous processing to minimize latency. Utilize event streaming platforms for high throughput.

- **Plugin Management**: Risk of plugin conflicts and difficulties in managing multiple integrations.
  - *Mitigation*: Establish clear versioning and compatibility guidelines for plugins, along with automated testing for new integrations.

- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Event-driven architectures can complicate monitoring and debugging efforts.
  - *Mitigation*: Integrate comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions to track events and identify issues quickly.

- **Learning Curve**: Teams may need time to adapt to the new architecture style.
  - *Mitigation*: Provide ongoing training and support to help teams become proficient in managing the event-driven microkernel architecture.

This decision aims to enhance our ability to integrate with various LLM providers and workflow effectively while ensuring adaptability, scalability, and minimal disruption in future integrations.
