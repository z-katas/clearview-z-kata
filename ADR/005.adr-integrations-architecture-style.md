# Integration Service for HR Platform Using Event-Driven Microkernel Architecture
Date: 2024-09-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We are developing an integration service to connect with various HR platforms, focusing on workflow requirements and high configurability. This service should leverage an event-driven architecture within a microkernel style, allowing for easy integration with new HR systems without necessitating redeployments. This approach will facilitate scalability, adaptability, and responsiveness to changing business needs.

### Alternatives
1. **Event-driven-microkernel**:  Microkernel for external HR platform and event driven for workflow and webhook service
2. **Point-to-Point Integration**: Directly connect each application to the HR platform.
3. **Custom API Gateway**: Create a bespoke API gateway for each HR platform.
4. **Monolithic Middleware**: Use a monolithic middleware service to handle all integrations.

### PrOACT

- **Problem**: How can we design a configurable integration service that integrates easily with various HR platforms and supports workflow requirements without new deployments?

- **Objectives**:
  - Enable seamless integration with multiple HR platforms.
  - Support high configurability for different HR workflows.
  - Ensure minimal disruption when adding new integrations.

- **Alternatives**: As described above.

- **Consequences**:
  - Event driven microkernel requires additional maintainance
  - Point-to-Point Integration leads to scalability issues and high maintenance overhead.
  - Custom API Gateway requires significant upfront investment for each platform.
  - Monolithic Middleware lacks flexibility and complicates future integrations.

- **Trade-offs**:
  - An event-driven microkernel architecture allows for extensibility but may require additional infrastructure for event management.
  - Monolithic solutions are simpler initially but limit scalability and adaptability over time.

## Decision
Adopt an event-driven microkernel architecture for the integration service. This design will use a core microkernel that handles common integration functionalities, while modular plugins will manage specific integrations with various HR platforms. Events will drive the communication between services and workflow, enabling real-time processing and easy scalability.

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Complexity**: The event-driven microkernel can introduce complexity in managing events and plugins.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement robust documentation and training programs, alongside a user-friendly interface for managing integrations and events.

- **Performance**: Potential latency due to the overhead of event processing and additional modules.
  - *Mitigation*: Optimize event handling and employ asynchronous processing to minimize latency. Utilize event streaming platforms for high throughput.

- **Plugin Management**: Risk of plugin conflicts and difficulties in managing multiple integrations.
  - *Mitigation*: Establish clear versioning and compatibility guidelines for plugins, along with automated testing for new integrations.

- **Monitoring and Debugging**: Event-driven architectures can complicate monitoring and debugging efforts.
  - *Mitigation*: Integrate comprehensive logging and monitoring solutions to track events and identify issues quickly.

- **Learning Curve**: Teams may need time to adapt to the new architecture style.
  - *Mitigation*: Provide ongoing training and support to help teams become proficient in managing the event-driven microkernel architecture.

This decision aims to enhance our ability to integrate with various HR platforms effectively while ensuring adaptability, scalability, and minimal disruption in future integrations.
