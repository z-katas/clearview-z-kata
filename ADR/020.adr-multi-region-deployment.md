# Multi-Region Deployment for High Availability and Compliance
Date: 2024-09-24

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Some of our application systems like resume, AI services requires high availability and must comply with GDPR and data residency regulations. To ensure reliability and meet these legal requirements, a multi-region deployment strategy is considered. This approach aims to enhance system resilience, provide low-latency access for users across different geographical locations, and ensure that data handling complies with local laws.

### Alternatives
1. **Single Region Deployment**: Host the application in one region.
2. **Hybrid Deployment**: Use a primary region for production and a secondary region for disaster recovery.
3. **Multi-Region with Data Segregation**: Deploy instances in multiple regions with each region handling data specific to its geographical area.

### PrOACT

- **Problem**: How can we ensure high availability and comply with GDPR/data residency laws while minimizing latency?
  
- **Objectives**:
  - Achieve low latency for global users.
  - Ensure compliance with GDPR and local data regulations.
  - Provide high availability and disaster recovery.

- **Alternatives**: As described above.

- **Consequences**:
  - Single Region Deployment may lead to latency issues and single points of failure.
  - Hybrid Deployment risks data non-compliance if not carefully managed.
  - Multi-Region with Data Segregation increases complexity but aligns with compliance and availability goals.

- **Trade-offs**:
  - Multi-region deployment has higher costs and operational complexity but provides resilience and compliance.
  - Requires advanced orchestration and monitoring tools to manage data flows and ensure data residency compliance.

## Decision
Adopt a multi-region deployment strategy for mission critical services for high availability, and also in case of GDPR each region maintains its data to comply with local data residency requirements. This approach will leverage automated replication strategies to ensure high availability and seamless failover while ensuring compliance with data handling regulations.

However, if cost and maintainance is paramount and doesn't have to worry about GDPR laws, we can start with Single region deployment and move to Hybrid model and then to complete multi-region model

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations
- **Cost**: Increased infrastructure costs associated with deploying in multiple regions. 
  - *Mitigation*: Implement usage-based pricing models and optimize resource allocation to reduce expenses.

- **Complexity**: Managing multiple regions adds operational complexity.
  - *Mitigation*: Invest in robust orchestration and monitoring tools to streamline deployment and maintenance processes.

- **Data Consistency**: Challenges with data synchronization across regions.
  - *Mitigation*: Utilize eventual consistency models and ensure clear data governance policies are in place.

- **Compliance Monitoring**: Need for continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing compliance.
  - *Mitigation*: Implement automated compliance checks and regular audits to maintain adherence to GDPR and data residency laws. 

By following this strategy, we can enhance our applicationâ€™s resilience while ensuring compliance with critical legal requirements.
