## Context

We need to select the optimal architectural approach for utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) within our system to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of natural language processing tasks. The primary use cases include question answering, summarization, and domain-specific knowledge retrieval. The system should balance performance, customization for domain-specific tasks, and operational costs.

### Alternatives

1. **Prompt Engineering**: Use carefully designed prompts to extract the best results from an existing LLM without modifying its internal weights.
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combine the LLM with an external knowledge base or document retrieval system to ground responses in specific, up-to-date information.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the LLM on domain-specific data to adapt its behavior and knowledge base to our needs.

### PrOACT

**Problem**: Choose the best architecture for leveraging an LLM to meet our requirements for performance, customization, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

**Objectives**:

- Achieve high-quality, contextually relevant responses.
- Minimize operational complexity and cost.
- Ensure adaptability for specific domain knowledge.
- Maintain a scalable and flexible system for future changes.

## Decision

Our strategy includes using a Hybrid Model with Prompt Engineering for resume tips and RAG for search-related use cases. Additionally, we may consider Fine-Tuning as a long-term approach to further enhance model performance. We will implement the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach wherever context augmentation is required, as it strikes the right balance between flexibility, domain-specific customization, and cost efficiency. This allows us to leverage external knowledge sources for specific queries while maintaining the core capabilities of the base LLM without the need for immediate fine-tuning or retraining

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations

- **Prompt Engineering** offers a faster path to integration but might struggle with very specific or niche queries.
- **RAG** enables more relevant, real-time information retrieval, but it introduces additional infrastructure complexity.
- **Fine-Tuning** allows the deepest level of customization at the cost of higher operational overhead and retraining needs.
- **Complexity**: RAG introduces architectural complexity due to the need for a reliable retrieval system. We will mitigate this by leveraging existing document storage and retrieval systems and automating the knowledge base updates.
- **Cost**: While RAG may increase operational costs compared to Prompt Engineering, it is significantly more cost-effective than fine-tuning. To manage costs, we will optimize the retrieval system to handle high-demand cases efficiently.
- **Performance**: The additional layer of retrieval could introduce latency. We will mitigate this by caching frequent queries and using efficient retrieval algorithms.
- **Customization**: RAG may not offer the deep customization of fine-tuning, but we will mitigate this by using focused knowledge bases and continually improving prompt design.
