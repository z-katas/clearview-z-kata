## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose a vector search algorithm to enable efficient and accurate retrieval of similar items from a large vectorized dataset. The algorithm must support large-scale searches with low latency while maintaining high accuracy in returning the nearest vectors for tasks such as semantic search, recommendation systems, and clustering.

### Alternatives

1. **Exact Nearest Neighbor (NN) Search**: Compute the exact distances between vectors for precise similarity results.
2. **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search**: Use an approximate search algorithm (e.g., FAISS, HNSW, ScaNN) to speed up retrieval times at the cost of slight accuracy loss.
3. **Hybrid Search**: Combine both exact and approximate searches where high precision is required for some queries and speed for others.

### PrOACT

**Problem**: Select the best vector search algorithm to balance speed, accuracy, and scalability when retrieving similar vectors from large datasets.

| Feature                | Exact NN Search                                         | Approximate NN Search (ANN)                                   | Hybrid Search                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**            | High latency due to full comparison of all vectors      | Low latency with faster search times, even for large datasets | Moderate, depends on when exact or ANN is used                  |
| **Scalability**        | Poor scalability, slows down with large datasets        | Highly scalable for large datasets                            | Scalable but adds complexity in managing both search types      |
| **Accuracy**           | 100% accuracy, always returns the true nearest neighbor | Slightly reduced accuracy but near-optimal for most cases     | Customizable accuracy depending on whether exact or ANN is used |
| **Computational Cost** | High computational cost, resource-intensive             | Low computational cost, optimized for performance             | Moderate to high, depending on the use case                     |

## Decision

We will implement an **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search** as it provides an excellent balance of speed and accuracy for our large-scale vector search requirements. ANN can scale efficiently with our growing dataset and maintain near-optimal search accuracy, making it suitable for our real-time application needs.

## Tradeoffs - Mitigations

- **Exact NN Search** is slow and resource-intensive for large datasets but guarantees 100% accuracy.
- **Approximate NN Search** offers faster retrieval with lower resource usage but sacrifices a small degree of accuracy.
- **Hybrid Search** allows flexibility but introduces additional system complexity, which may be overkill for many use cases.
- **Accuracy**: ANN can sacrifice some precision. We will mitigate this by tuning the trade-off between accuracy and speed, setting acceptable error margins based on use case criticality.
- **Complexity**: ANN introduces additional complexity compared to exact search algorithms, but we will use well-established libraries such as FAISS or HNSW to minimize the need for custom solutions and leverage existing optimizations.
- **Performance**: ANN significantly improves search speed, but we will ensure performance remains optimal by testing and tuning parameters like index structure and recall thresholds.
- **Scalability**: As our dataset grows, ANN will scale more efficiently compared to exact search. We will implement horizontal scaling strategies to ` ensure consistent performance as query volumes increase.
