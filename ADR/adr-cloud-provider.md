## Context

The Clearview Platform, being developed by an NGO, needs a cost-effective cloud provider with the following requirements:

- API Gateway
- Object Storage with Cold Storage Options
- Managed PostgreSQL
- Low-Cost Serverless Functions (Pay-per-request)
- Logging
- Sidecar Architecture
- CI/CD Pipeline
- Cost efficiency due to NGO funding constraints
- Other Non functional requirements of the system

We have chosen Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as the cloud provider for the Clearview Platform for the following reasons

- Cost Efficiency: GCP offers competitive pay-per-request pricing with substantial NGO credits. Given the cost constraints of the platform, this aligns well with our financial needs.

- Logging and Monitoring: Google Cloud Logging is well-integrated across all GCP services, providing real-time, centralized monitoring and insights, which will support our operational observability needs.

- Sidecar Architecture: GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) supports sidecar containers with seamless integration, allowing us to easily manage microservices patterns and ensure observability, security.

- CI/CD Pipeline: Cloud Build offers a managed CI/CD pipeline, with strong integration into GCP services. This aligns with our need for streamlined deployment processes, and supports automation with minimal overhead.

- Object Storage: Coldline Storage provides low-cost, long-term storage for resumes, particularly anonymized or archived versions, which is crucial for our platform's storage requirements.

- Managed PostgreSQL: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL meets the need for a fully managed relational database, ensuring high availability and scalability.

- AI/ML Future Needs: As the platform may eventually incorporate AI features like resume anonymization and recommendation engines, GCPâ€™s AI/ML suite is the strongest option for future-proofing, offering robust integrations with document analysis tools.
